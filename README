Implementation Overview

For each operation, I created a dedicated function to handle it.

    SHOW / SHOW_CURRENT Operations: These were processed and displayed immediately.
    UPDATE Operations: These were added to a queue for later execution.
    EXECUTE Operation: When encountered, an operation was dequeued and executed.
    UNDO/REDO Operations: Two stacks were used to store and retrieve the necessary pointers.

At the end, all allocated memory was freed by properly destroying the tape, queue, and stacks used.
